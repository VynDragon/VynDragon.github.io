				<h3>Instructions</h3>
				<p>
					First, build SDCC (8051 compiler) for C906 to compile on Duo.<br>
<br>
I am using a custom compiled Toolchain (from https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) BECAUSE NOTHING PREBUILT F*CKING WORKS RIGHT OMFG HOW HARD IS IT TO BUILD A WORKING GCC+GLIBC AND
NOT FAIL (yes i had obscure nonsensical errors building sdcc before I rebuilt the toolchain myself, it fixed the issue, i lost like 6 hours on this, do not use the official archlinux packaged
toolchain for riscv64 or any other options like that)<br>
For milk-v's toolchain mtune and march will be different (and it might not work at all for this, havent tried), look into the buildroot for examples of them.<br>
<br>
But we have a couple dependencies that need to be built for riscv64:<br>
<br>
for zlib:<br>
<code>
mkdir build<br>
cd build<br>
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/out -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/home/vdragon/dev/DUO/toolchain_c906.cmake ..<br>
make -j16<br>
make install<br>
</code>
<br>
for boost:<br>
<br>
<code>
# Build and setup boost.build (ONLY boost.build) for your system (google)<br>
# then:<br>
mkdir build<br>
cd build<br>
./build.sh<br>
</code>
<br>
And finally SDCC, which we build statically just to be sure:<br>
<br>
<code>
mkdir build<br>
cd build<br>
# build libs for sdcc devices, we need sdcc for that and it does it by itself, so build for host<br>
../configure --disable-pic14-port --disable-pic16-port<br>
make -j16<br>
make DESTDIR=$PWD/out install<br>
rm -r $PWD/out/usr/local/bin $PWD/out/usr/local/libexec<br>
make clean<br>
# and then delete everything but out and our scripts becasue make has the dumbs and will try to use the x86_64 files<br>
#build for riscv64 immediatly after<br>
configure.sh<br>
build.sh<br>
make DESTDIR=$PWD/out install<br>
</code>
Because i changed toolchain midway, my out folder is a mess, but the idea is to end up with bin, libexec, and share (the one from the host compilation) folders<br>

Grab those files, put them in your system image in the appropriate folders (copying the 3 folders in /usr/local is a good option)<br>

Check SDCC runs (if you didnt put it in /usr/local you might want to add that to PATH):<br>

I also grabbed a example to test functionality:<br>
